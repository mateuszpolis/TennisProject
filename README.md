# TennisProject


## Description

Web application to create, manage and analyze(not implemented yet) a database of tennis players, matches and tournaments.
The application predicts a winner based on their odds and biorythms for the day of the match. It auto updates adjusting the importance of each biorythm on different surfaces and levels (tournament ranks). In some cases the prediction is more accurate than just betting on a player with better odds.
